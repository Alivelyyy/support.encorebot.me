I'll help you create a ticket system website for support.encorebot.me. Let me clarify a few details to ensure I build exactly what you need:

User Authentication: Should users need to create an account/login to submit tickets, or should anyone be able to submit tickets with just their name and email?

Team Access: How would you like you and your team to access the admin panel to view and respond to tickets? Should there be a simple admin login, or would you prefer something else?

Ticket Categories: Would you like users to select a category when creating a ticket (e.g., "Discord Bot Support", "Website Issues", "General Inquiry"), or should all tickets go into one general queue?

Notifications: How should you and your team be notified of new tickets - email notifications, or just check the admin dashboard?

These details will help me create the most useful ticket system for your needs.
